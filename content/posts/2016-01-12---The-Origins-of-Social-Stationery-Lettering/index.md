Recently, I had a really smooth experience working with CI/CD, it made deploying my apps so much easier!ðŸ¥³

I set it up first with a Spring project on GCP(cloud run): building the app, pushing it to the container registry, and running it, all automatically. Watching the whole process happen without manual steps was honestly very satisfying!

I also gave Xcode Cloud a shot for an iOS project(Ù†Ù‚Ø§Ø¡), and setting it up was even easier than I expected. It barely took any configuration to get my builds running in the cloud and send an email to TestFlight users. Super clean and simple experience.

Definitely excited to integrate CI/CD into more of my future projects!
As part of this journey, I worked on a small spring service that list companies dividends and assembly meetings.
